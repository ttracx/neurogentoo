# THIS OVERLAY HAS BEEN DEPRECATED 

Gentoo Linux neuroscience ebuild development and distribution has been wholly moved to the [Gentoo Science Overlay](https://github.com/gentoo/sci).
We keep this repository online for redirection (many pages still link here) and historical reference.

# NeuroGentoo Overlay

NeuroGentoo is a persistent fork of the science overlay, this overlay provides *every* software package provided by [Gentoo Science](http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Science/Overlay) (including many neuroscience ebuilds).
Additionally, this repository provides a number of ebuilds not yet included by Gentoo Science.

## Install

As per the [current Portage specifications](https://dev.gentoo.org/~zmedico/portage/doc/man/portage.5.html), overlays should be managed via `/etc/portage/repos.conf/`.
To enable our overlay make sure you are using a recent Portage version (at least `2.2.14`), and create an `/etc/portage/repos.conf/neurogentoo` file containing precisely:

```
[neurogentoo]
location = /usr/local/portage/neurogentoo
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/TheChymera/neurogentoo.git
priority=8888
```

You can alternatively enable the Gentoo Science overlay, which should provide a similar usage experience (though somewhat slower access to the very newest neuroscience packages).
Simply cerate an `/etc/portage/repos.conf/science` file containing precisely:

```
[science]
location = /usr/local/portage/science
sync-type = git
sync-uri = https://github.com/gentoo-science/sci.git
priority=7777
```

Afterwards, simply run `emerge --sync`, and Portage should seamlessly make all our ebuilds available.
Many of our packages are available as live (`*-9999`) ebuilds, and need manual unmasking in `/etc/portage/package.accept_keywords` before they can be emerged.

## How To Cite

If you use Gentoo neuroscience ebuilds to manage software for your published research, we would be grateful if you were to cite our paper: [Gentoo Linux for Neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.3897/rio.3.e12095).
